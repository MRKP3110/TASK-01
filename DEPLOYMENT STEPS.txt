1. Set Up Remix IDE
        Open your browser and go to Remix IDE.

2. Create a New Solidity File
                              Once you are in Remix IDE:
                                                        In the left sidebar, go to the File Explorer.
                                                        Click on the + New File button.
                                                        Name your file
                                                        Write the Solidity code for SimpleToken into this file.

3. Compile the Contract
                        In the left sidebar, click on the Solidity Compiler.
                        Make sure the Compiler version matches the version used in the contract.
                        Click on the Compile SimpleToken.sol button. If everything is correct, the contract will compile successfully, and you should see a green checkmark next to the compiler version.

4. Set Up MetaMask
                  Install the MetaMask extension for Chrome or Firefox from MetaMask.
                  Once installed, open MetaMask and set up a wallet (if you don't have one already).
                  Ensure your MetaMask is connected to the Ethereum network.

5. Connect Remix to MetaMask
                            In the Remix IDE:
                                             On the left sidebar, click on the Deploy & Run Transactions.
                                             In the Environment dropdown, select Injected Web3. This will connect Remix to your MetaMask wallet.
                                             Ensure that MetaMask is connected to the correct Ethereum network. 
                                             Once connected, you should see your MetaMask account address in the Account dropdown.

6. Deploy the Contract
                      In Remix:
                               Under Deploy & Run Transactions, ensure that your contract (SimpleToken) is selected in the Contract dropdown.
                               You'll see a constructor input box asking for the initialSupply argument (this is the number of tokens you want to create).
                               For example, enter 1000 for 1000 STK tokens.
                               Click the Deploy button.
                               MetaMask will pop up asking you to confirm the transaction. Make sure the gas fee is acceptable to you and click Confirm.
                               Wait for the transaction to be mined. Once it's confirmed, your contract will be deployed.
